                    We will fund up to three participants in each of the three themes, listed below, that sit at the intersection of materials simulation and machine learning. The Bootcamp will strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration via hands on projects that will define the benefits and limitations of machine learning, introduce exciting open problems to the broader community, and stimulate new approaches to solving challenging open problems.

                    The Bootcamp will take place at the University of Sydney, with its uniquely relevant world-class research initiatives and institutes. The Bootcamp is organised by the <a href="https://sydney.edu.au/nano/grand-challenges/computational-materials-discovery.html">Computational Materials Design Grand Challenge</a> project of the <a href="https://sydney.edu.au/nano/">Sydney Nano Institute</a>, but will also draw on the expertise of researchers in the Faculty of Science, Centre for Translational Data Science (CTDS) and the Sydney Mathematical Research Institute (SMRI) . In addition, social activities are planned to help you make friends and take advantage of your stay in Australia and its beautiful environment.

                                There is little question that the sustainable reductive transformation of CO2 is one of the most important scientific and technical challenges of the 21st century. Machine learning methods have proven successful in the prediction of a large number of material properties. However, there is still a number of challenges in computational material sci-ences and there is a need for novel strategies to overcome them. Catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is one of the most important prototype reactions in heterogeneous catalysis, and the current big challenge is the lack of low-cost, highly selective, active and stable catalysts to synthesize valuable C2 chemicals.  This theme will assess the per-formance of existing methods for predicting the performance of carbon dioxide hydrogenation catalysts, and devel-op new ideas to accelerate the engineering and design of complex materials with improved functionalities.

Machine learning methods have proven successful in the prediction of a large number of material properties.

              <h3>Machine learning force fields for better solar cells</h3>
              <p>Solar cells incorporating perovskite materials are the fastest advancing solar technology to date, with the potential to be rapidly manufactured via energy efficient printing processes. Scaling up their printing, however, requires detailed understanding of how thin films of solid perovskites form from soluble precursors, including the effect of parameters such as temperature, solvent and additives. This project will develop force fields that can be used to simulate the steps involved in the formation of metal halide perovskites from solution. Recently, machine-learning has been used to construct force fields for a range of applications in material sciences, but they usually require tuning by hand and cannot be deployed at scale. We will overcome these limitations to develop general-purpose ap-proaches for this important class of materials.

              <h3>Machine learning for the quantum control of an experimental quantum simulator</h3>
              <p>
                Quantum computing is the latest frontier in materials science, promising simulations that are exponentially faster than possible on conventional computers. At USyd, we are developing a state of the art trapped ion quantum computer that will be able to simulate, with existing technology, the otherwise intractable quantum-mechanical equations that describe processes in chemistry and materials science. However, like all quantum computers, the performance of our device is adversely impacted by noise or fluctuations in its environment. This project will design control protocols to be optimised over the enormous space of experimentally controllable parameters to improve our computations and their resilience to noise.
